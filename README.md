# NOMIS API Example

The workbook provides an example script for accessing the NOMIS API to obtain population and mortality information.

NOMIS is a service provided by the United Kingdom Office for National Statistics (ONS) for distributing information gathered from census and other tools.

The workbook requires an output folder to be created in the root of the project call "X_Output" this folder is not replicated to github to preserve confidentiality of data (and prevent sharing of large files).
